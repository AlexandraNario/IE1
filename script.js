//Objective: Using the Demo #1 slides, create separate files for each remaining mathematical operation: subtract, multiply, and divide.

//Fellows will test these operations on their own, ensuring that their code is error/bug free, returning accurate results for their calculations.

//Objective: Create separate files each a with mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiply, etc). Import those files into a primary file (calculator.js) that can execute all the operations via importing their functionality.
//Follow along: 
//Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where all your projects are located.
//Create a new folder called import-export-practice and go inside the folder
//Type the command npm init -y and press enter. This will create a new node project in this directory
//Create 2 files - add.js and calculator.js
//Create a function inside add.js should that takes 2 arguments: num1 and num2. 
//The function should add the two arguments and return the result
//In the add.js file, make sure you are using either export default or export {} to enable exporting the function
//In the calculator.js file, import the add.js file and use the add() function
//**make sure to include file extension - add.js
